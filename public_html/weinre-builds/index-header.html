<h1>weinre pre-release builds</h1>

<p>The files here are pre-release builds of weinre.

<p>Although the directory structure and names correspond
to what you would see in an "official" Apache release,

<blockquote>
<span class="warning">THESE ARE NOT OFFICIAL APACHE RELEASES</span>
</blockquote>

<p>Enjoy!
